# py_astroclod
This is a Python repository with some of the programs developed during my PhD in astrophysics. It contains programs to read astronomical spectra (acquired with some of the most common instruments) and some utilities for spectra analysis. The repository is currently under construction, I plan to review and add more code from my PhD code archive.
